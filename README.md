#SpyUTT

SpyUTT is an application which illustrates the vulnerability of iOS 6.
In this project, we pretend to be a malicious app who tried to get as
much data as possible and send them to our own server via http request.

We have seperated data by the following kinds:

1. Contacts
2. Calendars \& Reminders
3. Photoss \& metadata
4. Locations data
5. Applications
	* Current Process
	* Installed applications
	* App usage distribution
  
6. Device Info
